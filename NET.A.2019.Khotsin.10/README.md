1. Implement various types of a string representation of Book ([day 8 homework](../NET.A.2019.Khotsin.08/BookListService.Library/Model)) objects.
- [Class library project](BookTasks) ([Model](BookTasks/Model) and [Decorator](BookTasks/Decorator) folders)
2. Add an additional formatting option for objects of the Book class without changing the class.
- [Class library project](BookTasks) ([ExtensionMethods](BookTasks/ExtensionMethods) folder)
3. Implement unit tests for functionalities from pp. 1-2.
- [Tests project](BookTasks.Tests)
4. Refactor class (in order to reduce repeated code) in Euclidean algorithms (use delegates for refactoring). The class interface should not change.
- [Class library project](EuclidsAlgorithm)
- [Tests project](EuclidsAlgorithm.Tests)
