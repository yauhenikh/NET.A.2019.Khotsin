1. Develop generic Queue class, implement basic operations for working with a queue. Implement an iterator "manually" (without using yield block iterator). Implement unit tests.
- [Class library project](CustomQueue.Library)
- [Tests project](CustomQueue.Tests)
2. Create generic classes to represent square, symmetric and diagonal matrices. Create an event raising when a matrix element with indices (i, j) changes. Extend class hierarchy by adding the ability to add two matrices of any type. Implement unit tests.
- [Class library project](Matrix.Library)
- [Console UI project](Matrix.Tests)
3. Develop generic BinarySearchTree class (assume using custom interface to implement order relationships). Implement three ways to traverse the tree: preorder, inorder, postorder (use yield block iterator). Implement unit tests with following types: System.Int32 (use default comparer and custom comparer), System.String (use default comparer and custom comparer), custom Book class (use default comparer and custom comparer), custom Point struct (use custom comparer).
