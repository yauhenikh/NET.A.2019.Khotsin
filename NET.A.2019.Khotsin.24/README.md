Add a DAL implementation to the project for working with bank accounts (Homework. Day 15) using ORM ADO.NET Entity Framework. Develop console application. Make changes in solution (BLL, BLL.Interface, etc) if necessary.

Added project to solution:
- [Data access layer database project](DAL.Database)

There were little changes in the [ConsoleUI](ConsoleUI) project ([Program.cs](ConsoleUI/Program.cs) file) and in the [DependencyResolver](DependencyResolver) project ([ResolverConfig.cs](DependencyResolver/ResolverConfig.cs) file).
