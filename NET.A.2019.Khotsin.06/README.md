1. Develop an immutable Polynomial class for working with polynomials of a real type (use a sz-array to store coefficients). Override virtual methods of the Object class. Overload operations acceptable for working with polynomials including "==" and "!=". Implement unit tests.
2. Implement the algorithm for bubble sorting of a integer jagged array. Sort rows of the matrix in order of increasing (decreasing) the sum of the elements of the rows; in ascending (descending) order of the maximum elements of the rows; in ascending (descending) order of the minimum elements of the rows.
