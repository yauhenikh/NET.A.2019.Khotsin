1. Develop a class to calculate GCD of two, three or more integer numbers using Euclid's algorithm. Add methods to calculate GCD using Stein's algorithm (binary GCD algorithm). Methods should also calculate the time of finding GCD. Implement unit tests.
2. Implement extension method to get string binary representation of a double precision real number in IEEE 754 format. Implement unit tests.
