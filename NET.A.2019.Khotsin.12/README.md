1. Implement logging messages with different log levels (assume using of the different logging frameworks) for the BookListService application.
- [Class library project](BookListService.Library) ([Logger](BookListService.Library/Logger) folder)
- [Tests project](BookListService.Logger.Tests)
2. Develop a class to simulate timer (the waiting time is provided by the user). Implement the event raising after the time is over (other classes can subscribe to the event). Implement console application.
- [Class library project](Timer.Library)
- [Console UI project](Timer.ConsoleUI)
3. Implement generic binary search algorithm (do not use generic constraints). Implement unit tests.
- [Class library project](BinarySearch.Library)
- [Tests project](BinarySearch.Tests)
4. Implement a method to generate Fibonacci sequence.
- [Class library project](FibonacciNumbersGenerator.Library)
- [Tests project](FibonacciNumbersGenerator.Tests)
